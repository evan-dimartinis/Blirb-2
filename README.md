# Blirb

Blirb is an app created by myself and 2 friends that allows users to recommend and keep track of their favorite books, podcasts, TV shows, and movies.

This repository holds the beginnings of Blirb 2.0, which I have started developing recently in an attempt to completely re-design the old application, which was functional but not-so-pretty.

For more details about the overall application, you can visit the old repo here: <href>https://github.com/evan-dimartinis/BlirbReactNativePublic</href>

The end goal of this project is to have an MVP to publish on the apple app store and below you will find the first iterations of the new design.
